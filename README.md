3. Run "node server.js"
4. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Key Principles
1. Create advanced websites without code
2. Reusable Sandboxed Widgets
3. File based configuration based on url

## Todo
* Moving widgets from zone to zone
* Sorting widgets
* Create a "model" stored in the file system
* Create a "model" stored in MongoDB
* Fields cleanup (remove "fields" dependency)
* Fix fillValues function to support deeper values
* Multi-valued fields
* Heirarchical fields
* Composition of fields
* Interal library functions
* CSS/JS Aggregation

## Unsure
* Models backed by SQL?
